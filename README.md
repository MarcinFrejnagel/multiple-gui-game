# Simple GUI with tictactoe and dices game

## TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe is a player vs bot game where each one takes turns marking either "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid.
The objective of the game is to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is a tie.

## Dices

Dices is a game where players roll one or more dice and try to achieve the highest score possible.
Each player (user or bot) takes turns rolling the dices till the score will be satisfied.
The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
